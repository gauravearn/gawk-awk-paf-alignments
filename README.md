# gawk_awk_paf_aligned_genome_fractions
a combination of the gawk and the awk basic compiler to create a function that will estimate teh aligned genome fractions from the paf alignment of the genome long reads to the genome. This includes multiple functions which also allow for the filtering of the quality alignments before estimating the genome length coverage.
